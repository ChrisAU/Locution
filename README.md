Scrabble game written in Swift implementing the PapyrusCore for the game logic.

AI supports varying levels of difficulty.

Outstanding ToDo's:
- Lookahead to reduce time spent waiting between turns.
- Ability to return tiles to bag.
- Ability to calculate a hint?
- Ability to swap tiles. AI handles this automatically, there is currently no UI for human players to do this.
